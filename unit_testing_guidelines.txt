Each new change to the code in the COAsT repository needs to be testing against a number
criteria. This is to ensure that:

	1a) The new changes work as intended
	1b) The changes don't break any other parts of the project.
	
This testing is done in a unit testing script, which tests all parts of the code and
grows with the project. Two checks should be made for a feature:

	2a) The feature runs without crashing. Can be done in a try except statement.
	2b) Output is as intended. This can be done by comparing automated
	    output to a known and confirmed output.
	    
Primarily, any new feature should work for the India domain. In general however, any
feature should be able to handle data:

	3a) With Curvilinear coordinates on a tripolar grid.
	3b) Near or over the longitude 'seam' of a model grid. 
	3c) Near or through domain boundaries.
	3d) Near or through coastlines.
	3e) Near or through geographical poles (latitude = 90 or -90).
	3f) Near or through grid poles (poles of a tripolar grid).
	3g) Near or through the equator.
