"""
This is a demonstration script for using the Altimetry object in the COAsT
package. This object has strict data formatting requirements, which are
outlined in altimetry.py.
"""

# Begin by importing coast and other packages
import coast

# And by defining some file paths
dn_files = "./example_files/"
fn_nemo_dat = dn_files + "coast_example_nemo_data.nc"
fn_nemo_dom = dn_files + "coast_example_nemo_domain.nc"
fn_nemo_config = "./config/example_nemo_grid_t.json"
fn_altimetry = dn_files + "coast_example_altimetry_data.nc"
fn_altimetry_config = "./config/example_altimetry.json"

# We need to load in a NEMO object for doing NEMO things.
nemo = coast.Gridded(fn_nemo_dat, fn_nemo_dom, config=fn_nemo_config)

# And now we can load in our Altimetry data. By default, Altimetry is set up
# to read in CMEMS netCDF files. However, if no path is supplied, then the
# object's dataset will be initialised as None. Custom data can then be loaded
# if desired, as long as it follows the data formatting for Altimetry.
# altimetry = coast.Altimetry(fn_altimetry)
altimetry = coast.Altimetry(fn_altimetry, config=fn_altimetry_config)

# Before going any further, lets just cut out the bit of the altimetry that
# is over the model domain. This can be done using subset_indices_lonlat_box
# to find relevant indices and then isel to extract them. The data has also
# been thinned slightly.
ind = altimetry.subset_indices_lonlat_box([-10, 10], [45, 60])
ind = ind[::4]
altimetry = altimetry.isel(t_dim=ind)

# Before comparing our observations to the model, we will interpolate a model
# variable to the same time and geographical space as the altimetry. This is
# done using the obs_operator() method:
altimetry.obs_operator(nemo, mod_var_name="ssh", time_interp="nearest")

# Doing this has created a new interpolated variable called interp_ssh and
# saved it back into our Altimetry object. Take a look at altimetry.dataset
# to see for yourself.
#
# Next we will compare this interpolated variable to an observed variable
# using some basic metrics. The basic_stats() routine can be used for this,
# which calculates some simple metrics including differences, RMSE and
# correlations. NOTE: This may not be a wise choice of variables.
stats = altimetry.basic_stats("ocean_tide_standard_name", "interp_ssh")

# Take a look inside stats.dataset to see all of the new variables. When using
# basic stats, the returned object is also an Altimetry object, so all of the
# same methods can be applied. Alternatively, if you want to save the new
# metrics to the original altimetry object, set create_new_object = False.
#
# Now we will do a more complex comparison using the Continuous Ranked
# Probability Score (CRPS). For this, we need to hand over the model object,
# a model variable and an observed variable. We also give it a neighbourhood
# radius in km (nh_radius).
crps = altimetry.crps(nemo, model_var_name="ssh", obs_var_name="ocean_tide_standard_name", nh_radius=20)

# Again, take a look inside crps.dataset to see some new variables. Similarly
# to basic_stats, create_new_object can be set to false to save output to
# the original altimetry object.
#
# Altimetry has a ready built quick_plot() routine for taking a look at any
# of the observed or derived quantities above. So to take a look at the
# 'sla_filtered' variable:
fig, ax = altimetry.quick_plot("ocean_tide_standard_name")

# As stats and crps are also Altimetry objects, quick_plot() can also be used:
fig, ax = crps.quick_plot("crps")
fig, ax = stats.quick_plot("absolute_error")
