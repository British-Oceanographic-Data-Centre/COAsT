** Notes on Object Structure and Loading (for contributors):

COAsT is an object-orientated package, meaning that data is stored within Python object
structures. In addition to data storage, these objects contain methods (subroutines)
which allow for manipulation of this data.  An example of such an object is the NEMO 
object, which allows for the storage and manipulation of NEMO output and domain data. It 
is important to understand how to load data using COAsT and the structure of the resulting 
objects.

A NEMO object is created and initialised by passing it the paths of the domain and data 
files. Ideally, the grid type should also be specified (T, U, V or F in the case of NEMO). 
For example, to load in data from a file containing data on a NEMO T-grid:

```
import coast

fn_data = '<path to T-grid data file(s)>'
fn_domain = '<path to domain file>'

data = coast.NEMO(fn_data, fn_domain, grid_ref='t-grid')
```

Ideally, NEMO output data should be in grid-specific files, i.e. containing output
variables situated on a NEMO T, U, V or F grid. The whole domain file is supplied, 
however only grid specific variables are placed into the NEMO object. A NEMO object 
therefore contains grid-specific data and all corresponding grid variables. One of the 
file names can beomitted (to get a data-only or grid only object), however functionality
in this case will be limited.

Once loaded, data is stored inside the object using an xarray.dataset object. Following
on from the previous code example, this can be viewed by calling:

```
data.dataset
```
This reveals all netcdf-type aspects of the data and domain variables that were loaded,
including dimensions, coordinates, variables and attributes. For example:
```
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:              (axis_nbounds: 2, t_dim: 7, x_dim: 297, y_dim: 375, z_dim: 51)

Coordinates:
    time                 (t_dim) datetime64[ns] 2007-01-01T11:58:56 ... 2007-01-31T11:58:56
    longitude            (y_dim, x_dim) float32 ...
    latitude             (y_dim, x_dim) float32 ...
Dimensions without coordinates: axis_nbounds, t_dim, x_dim, y_dim, z_dim

Data variables:
    deptht_bounds        (z_dim, axis_nbounds) float32 ...
    sossheig             (t_dim, y_dim, x_dim) float32 ...
    time_counter_bounds  (t_dim, axis_nbounds) datetime64[ns] ...
    time_instant         (t_dim) datetime64[ns] ...
    temperature          (t_dim, z_dim, y_dim, x_dim) float32 ...
    e1                   (y_dim, x_dim) float32 ...
    e2                   (y_dim, x_dim) float32 ...
    e3_0                 (z_dim, y_dim, x_dim) float32 1.0 1.0 1.0 ... 1.0 1.0
```
Variables may be obtained in a number of ways. For example, to get temperature data, the
following are all equivalent:
```
temp = data.dataset.temperature
temp = data.dataset['temperature']
temp = data['temperature']
```
These commands will all return an xarray.dataarray object. Manipulation of this object
can be done using xarray commands, for example indexing using [] or xarray.isel. Be aware
that indexing will preserve lazy loading, however and direct access or modifying of the 
data will not. For this reason, if you require a subset of the data, it is best to 
index first.

The names of common grid variables are standardised within the COAsT package for
consistency and ease of use. Along with their original NEMO names, these are:

1. longitude [glamt / glamu / glamv / glamf]
2. latitude  [gphit / gphiu / gphiv / gphif]
3. time      [time_counter]
4. e1        [e1t / e1u / e1v / e1f] (dx variable)
5. e2        [e1t / e1u / e1v / e1f] (dy variable)
6. e3_0      [e3t_0 / e3u_0 / e3v_0 / e3f_0] (dz variable at time 0)

Longitude, latitude and time are also set as coordinates. You might notice that dimensions 
are also standardised:

1. x_dim   The dimension for the x-axis (longitude)
2. y_dim   The dimension for the y-axis (latitude)
3. t_dim   The dimension for the time axis
4. z_dim   The dimension for the depth axis.

Wherever possible, the aim is to ensure that all of the above is consistent across the
whole COAsT toolbox. Therefore, you will also find the same names and dimensions in, for
example observation objects. Future objects, where applicable, will also follow these 
conventions. If you (as a contributor) add new objects to the toolbox, following
the above template is strongly encouraged. This includes using xarray dataset/dataarray
objects where possible, adopting an object oriented approach and adhering to naming 
conventions.
